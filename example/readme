JAVA virtual machine 1.6 or above is required.

Put the jar file (bomp.release.jar) in the same directory, then you should be able to run the following command:
java -Xmx4000M -jar bomp.release.jar -p example.phenotype -v example.var -g example.geno -u example.gene --permutation 1000 --geneSet gene.set

Here, I simply explain the format of each file. The current parameter setting
is designed for missense mutations in protein sequences. The algorithm can be
applied on DNA sequences of course but the parameters (such as window size)
might need to be changed to get better result. For example, the window size of
8 may be too small for DNA sequences.

############ Phenotype file (example.phenotype) ############

Format:
<sample id>,<case-control status (1 for case, 0 for control)>

sample id needs to be unique.

############ variant definition file (example.var) ############

Format:
<variant id>,<gene name>,<gene name (designed for other use in the future)>,<position>,<bioinformatic score>

variant id needs to be unique for each variant. note that column 2 and 3
are the name of the gene where the variant is. the position is for mutation
position statistic. since we currently focused on missense mutations,
positions are amino acid positions in proteins. A bioinformatics score
bewteen 0 (neutral) and 1 (deleterious) indicates its deleteriousness.

############ genotype file (example.geno) ############

Format:
<var 1-sample 1>,<var 2-sample 1>, ... ,<var n-sample 1>
<var 1-sample 2>,<var 2-sample 2>, ... ,<var n-sample 2>
...
<var 1-sample m>,<var 2-sample m>, ... ,<var n-sample m>

Row represent samples. Columns represent variants. Genotypes are 0 (homozygous
ref), 1 (heterozygous), and 2 (homozygous alt). The order of samples needs to
be consistent with the order in phenotype file (i.e. k-th row corresponds to the
genotypes of the k-th sample in the phenotype file). The order of variants
needs to be consistent with the order in variant definition file (i.e. the
genotypes in the k-th column corresponds to the variant in the k-th row in
the variant definition file).

############ gene definition file (example.gene) ############

Format:
<gene name>,<length>

Be sure that the gene length needs to be greater than the position of any
variant occurred in that gene.

############ gene set file (gene.set) ############

Format:
<set name>\t<description>\t<gene name>[\t<gene name>]

the format follows the text format used in MSigDB (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp).

--permutation specifies the number of permutations.
